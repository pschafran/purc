Reading alignment file C_mou_8656/C_mou_8656_Cluster_FinalconsensusSsC0.997dCh_renamed.fa.MAFFT ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains DNA/RNA sequences
WARNING: 1 sites contain only gaps or ambiguous characters.
Alignment has 4 sequences with 695 columns, 59 distinct patterns
9 parsimony-informative, 44 singleton sites, 642 constant sites
WARNING: Some sequence names are changed as follows:
C_mou_8656_Cluster16;size=11 -> C_mou_8656_Cluster16_size_11
