[PPP_Configuration]
Mode					= 0		# 0: Construct blast database for barcodes and reference sequences, and then "full run"
								# 1: Full run, assuming blast database exists
								# 2: Just split. PPP will take the (already annotated) Input_sequence_file and split it up by split_type
								# 3: Just clustering, etc. PPP will take the file(s) in Output_folder and run clustering and chimera-killing on them		
									#NOTE: ppp must be called from the folder that has Output_folder already in it (and the files need to already be in Output_folder)

Multiplex_per_barcode	= 0		# 0: Each barcode contains only one sample
								# 1: Each barcode contains multiple samples
