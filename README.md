# PURC: Polyploids Untangling by Rothfels and Carl#

### Overview ###
PURC is a pipeline for extracting alleles from amplicon sequencing data (PacBio, Illumina,...etc), and is geared toward analyzing polyploid species complexes. 

Workflow for PacBio amplicon seq:

* Check concatemers and split them if requested (more on concatemers [here](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/cDNA_primer/wiki/Artificial-concatemers,-PCR-chimeras,-and-fusion-genes))
* Identify barcodes and remove them
* Trim primers and other adapters
* Assign each sequence to specimen based on the barcode and user-specified reference database
* Cluster and remove chimeric sequences, iteratively
* Woop woop

### Purc compatibility ###
Purc works on Mac machines. We have not tested it on Linux and PC. [TODO]

### To setup ###
Purc is consist of purc.py and a number of dependencies. We bundled most of the dependencies (cutadapt, muscle and usearch) together in the distribution. To get dependencies in place, cd to the purc directory, and type: 
```
#!shell
./install_dependencies.sh
```
If you get "permission denied" error, then try this first:
```
#!shell
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

There are however three other dependencies that you have to install yourself:

* [Python](https://www.python.org) - Version 2.7 or later. We have not tested purc on Python 3, and it will probably not work.
* [BioPython](http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page) - Version 1.6 or later. You need to have [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) in place before installing BioPython. Please refer to BioPython [manual](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/install/Installation.htmlall/Installation.html) for installation instruction.
* [BLAST+](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download) - Version 2.2.30 or later. Place the executables in your PATH. If you are using Mac, the easiest way is to download the .dmg file and follow the installer's instruction. To test if this is installed correctly, open Terminal and type "blastn -h" (without quotations). If you see a bunch of stuff pooped out (i.e. "USAGE: ...blah blah blah"), then you are good to go. However, if you get "command not found" error, then BLAST is not installed correctly.  


### To run ###
First, cd to the directory where your sequence file is located. Make a configuration file (there are several examples distributed with purc. Purc takes in all the information needed from that configuration file, and can be run by: 
```
#!shell
/Users/fayweili/Programs/purc/purc.py ppp_configuration.txt > log.txt
```
This assumes that the purc directory is in /Users/fayweili/Programs. **DO NOT** copy purc.py to your working directory; instead, call purc.py from there. Alternative, you can add the purc directory into your PATH, and in this case, you can run by: 
```
#!shell
purc.py ppp_configuration.txt > log.txt
```
